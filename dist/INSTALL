Requirements
============

Cuanto requires an application server running Java 1.5 or greater and a SQL database with a JDBC driver. Development
and testing have been done against a Jetty/MySQL combination.

Customizing cuanto-db.groovy

Edit cuanto-db.groovy with a text editor.  You'll see a section like this:
		production {
			dataSource {
				username = "my_sql_user"
				password = "my_sql_password"
				driverClassName = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
				url = "jdbc:mysql://my_sql_server:3306/cuanto?autoreconnect=true"
			}
		}

Edit the username, password, driverClassName and url to correspond to the correct values for your database
credentials, JDBC driver and the JDBC URL for your SQL server.  Make sure you edit the "production" section.


Deploying the application
=========================

Unzip the WAR into your application server's webapps directory into a subdirectory named "cuanto". Copy the
cuanto-db.groovy you customized into the cuanto/WEB-INF/classes directory.  Put your JDBC driver in the
cuanto/WEB-INF/lib directory.

The application should be ready to run now -- start your application server and go to the appropriate URL
for cuanto (this will depend on how you've deployed it). Go to the root Cuanto URL and click on the 'Help' menu
link to read about how to use Cuanto.


Upgrading
=========
If you are upgrading from an existing Cuanto installation, you'll want to execute the SQL scripts
found in the sql directory. These scripts have been tested on MySQL with the InnoDB engine, tweaks may
be needed if using a different database configuration.
