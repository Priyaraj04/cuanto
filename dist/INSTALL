Customizing cuanto-db.groovy

Edit cuanto-db.groovy with a text editor.  You'll see a section like this:
		production {
			dataSource {
				username = "my_sql_user"
				password = "my_sql_password"
				driverClassName = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
				url = "jdbc:mysql://my_sql_server:3306/cuanto?autoreconnect=true"
			}
		}

Edit the username, password, driverClassName and url to correspond to the correct values for your database
credentials, JDBC driver and the JDBC URL for your SQL server.  Make sure you edit the "production" section.


Deploying the application

Unzip the WAR into your application server's webapps directory into a subdirectory named "cuanto". Copy the
cuanto-db.groovy you customized into the cuanto/WEB-INF/lib directory, along with your JDBC driver.

The application should be ready to run now -- start your application server and go to the appropriate URL
for cuanto (this will depend on how you've deployed it). Go to the root Cuanto URL and click on the 'Help' menu
link to read about how to use Cuanto.
