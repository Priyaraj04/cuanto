* You can now associate arbitrary properties and hyperlinks with a TestRun:
(ant example here)
* The Build, Milestone and Target Environment properties have been removed from TestRun, any existing values will be
migrated to the new property style with corresponding names.
* Test outcomes now have startedAt and finishedAt properties (if the test typee supports them -- presently just TestNG)
* Fix a JUnit parsing error when JUnit test time exceeds 1000 seconds
* Allow exporting test results in CSV, TSV and XML formats
* Normalize all time units to milliseconds, pretty-print time formats as HH:MM:ss.zzz
* Clicking on the output panel icon when that outcome's output is already being displayed will now hide the output panel
* Fix CUANTO-34, Searching with the Unanalyzed Failures filter returns non-failures.
* Sorting by test output now works
* Other minor bug fixes
